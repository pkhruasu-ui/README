# Welcome to Slicon Valley English-Vietnamese Toastmaster
Welcome to our little hangout place. As you know, everyone is here to improve their public speaking skill. It is going to take you quite a while to adjust to our club. You might feel the urge to shy away from being put under a spotlight or give a speech. And you might get the feeling that we would try to push you as much as you can. But let me assured you, everyone here does this with good faith.

### Transformational Leadership
I have a tough love mentality when it comes to anyone I care. There is no better joy to me than seeing a member set up a small challenge by themselves and strife to complete it. But since this is not a school or workplace. The challenge should not be monumental or time consuming. We have our own career and family to worry about after all.

### Our Average Meeting & Rules
We go to a predefined time and place, do 3 sections dictated by the organization (prepared speech, table topic, evaluation), and have food afterward. Any special event will be announced or may just be an impromptu if I found something interesting we can try.

For some of the basic rules, include but not limited to:
 - If we have less than 4 people, we cancel the meeting.
 - Every meeting must have at least 1 speaker, whether it is a partial or incomplete speech. I am ok with unprepared speech and you can come back over and over until you are satisfied ( or we get bored of it).
 - Anything is permitted if members can benefit from it. Whether it is workshop, work-related presentation, a toast in a wedding. Toastmaster setup is a "guideline", not a law. 


                                       "If it is good, keeep it going. If not, wrap it up."
                              "You can do anything you want, as long as you don't cause any trouble"
 
 - We still need to run this club like an organization. So don't act without a consent from officers ( until you are an officer).  

## What I would expect from you
1. Speak your goal. Everyone has their own agenda and I would not like to play a mind-guessing game. If you say you can do once a month. I am totally fine with it, even if you want to quit. Just let us know ahead of time.
2. Be consistent. I value action than words.
3. Don't dissappoint yourself. Personal improvement is ...personal. Garbage in, garbage out. You get what you put in.
4. Respect people's background who might have different opinion from you.

## What you could expect from us
1. A platform. everyone chips in their valuable time to keep the club running. I don't want to make it feels like a second job for people. This is a hobby afterall.
2. Camaraderie. This place is not a job and I would love for professional people to connect more on a personal level. We have food and share story after the meeting. Sometimes we go out hiking. Toastmaster is for toasting the good story being told.
3. Semi-casual atmoshphere. 



# A litile bit about myself
I am from Thailand. I have 2 younger brothers and 2 older cousins( I consider them older brothers) who have been with me since I was a kid. Love small dogs and cats.

I can enjoy nightlife and/or enjoy reading a good book on a relax day.

I feel older than I normally am. Have a crush on so many older women.

**I am a realist but not extremist**. I don't believe that everyone has to strife for perfection or that we all have a great destiny ahead.

I work in some shapes or forms all throughout my life so I don't have much experience in casual social setting ( hence a bit introvert ).

**Excessive talking** is a trigger for me.

**All talk and no action** is a trigger for me.
My way of talking is a bit in-your-face style.
I have too much pride( proven by friends ) so I probably need a therapy.

#### Something I learn throughout my life
1. Put yourself in an environment that helps you grow, or grow your own environment. (2014)
2. You should be rewarded for things you are good at, monetary or not. (2015)
3. Do not mistake friends with collegues.(2013) 
4. Walk the line between self centric and people centric. You don't want to be an ungrateful person or people pleaser.(2017)
5. People don't change by you. They change themselves.(2011) 
6. Do not put too much emotional investment into something that does not have a good return in _money or relationship_. (2018) 
7. Automate decision for small things like, for example where to park at the office, what to eat during lunch, or should we have meeting 
   or not. (2014)
