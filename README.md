# Welcome to Slicon Valley English-Vietnamese Toastmaster
Welcome to our little hangout place. As you know, everyone is here to improve their public speaking skill. It is going to take you quite a while to adjust to our club. You might feel the urge to shy away from being put under a spotlight or give a speech. And you might get the feeling that we would try to push you as much as you can. But let me assured you, everyone here is doing this with good faith.

# Transformational Leadership
I think of myself as having a tough love mentality when it comes to personal improvement or to anyone I care. There is no better joy to me than seeing a member set up a small challenge by themselves and strife to complete it. But since this is not a school or workplace. The challenge should not be monumental or time consuming. We have our own work and family to worry about after all.

# Our Average Meeting & Rules
We go to a predefined time and place, do 3 sections dictated by the organization (prepared speech, table topic, evaluation), and have food afterward. I am flexible enough that I would not be holding resentment if any meeting will be in a complete failure (we have had those).

# What I would expect from you
1. Speak your goal. Everyone has their own agenda and I would not like to play a mind-guessing game. If you say you can do once a month  
   and can only give a speech once every two months. I am totally fine with it.
2. Be consistent. I value action than words. 

# What you could expect from us
